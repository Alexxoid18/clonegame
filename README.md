## Project Overview

This project represents a classic arcade game Frogger.

## Why this Project?

Games have a lot of objects and those objects do a lot of different things; but sometimes they do some very similar things as well. This creates a great opportunity to practice object-oriented programming, an important programming paradigm that influences your application architecture and provides performance optimization.

## How to start?

The repository contains css, images, and js folders, as well as an index.html and a README.md file. To start this project you should open index.html file in your browser. 

## How to play?

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down, using appropriate key arrows on a keyboard. The player cannot move off screen.
The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
